A proof-of-concept content scheduling system implementing advanced drag-and-drop capabilities with time-based granularity and real-time state management.

## Core Features

- **Temporal Task Management**: Implements hierarchical time-slotting with day/hour granularity
- **Reactive DnD Interface**: Leverages `@dnd-kit` for performant drag-and-drop operations
- **State Persistence**: Real-time sync with Supabase backend
- **Compound Components**: Built with shadcn/ui primitives for robust UI composition
- **Responsive Interactions**: Micro-interactions and motion design for enhanced UX

## Technical Stack

- React 18 with TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS for utility-first styling
- Radix UI primitives
- Supabase for backend services

## Disclaimer

This is an experimental proof-of-concept implementation. The repository may be archived or removed without notice as it serves primarily as a technical demonstration.
